    question:
      'When does the <code>*axLazyElement</code> directive trigger download of the element bundle (or module)',
    answer:
      'The element loading will be postponed until it was rendered in the template of some component. This can happen in following cases... <br>' +
      `
       <ul>
        <li>Angular component uses element in its template</li>
        <li>
          Angular component uses element in its template conditionally
          (<code>*ngIf</code>, <code>*ngFor</code>, ...) and the condition was
          fulfilled
        </li>
        <li>
          User navigated to an Angular component which uses element in its template
          (can be both eagerly or lazily loaded routes)
        </li>
      </ul>
      `

    question:
      'What will happen if I use same element multiple times in single template?',
    answer:
      'The element bundle will be downloaded only once! The library takes care of this situation by maintaining registry of downloaded / downloading elements and every new occurence will be checked against that  registry...'
  },
  {
    question:
      'When do we need to use <code>*axLazyElement="module: true"</code> flag?',
    answer:
      'Some web components libraries might be distributed using ES modules, for example if we look at <a href="https://unpkg.com/@material/mwc-button@0.6.0/mwc-button.js?module" target="_blank">@material/mwc-button</a> we will see that it imports additional things like <code>@material/mwc-base</code> using import statement in its implementation. This means it will need to download multiple files compared to a single bundle when using Angular elements. To make this work, library has to generate <code>\t&#60;script type="module"></code> instead of just plain <code>\t&#60;script></code> tag.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Angular elements / web components / custom elements / what?',
    answer:
      'In the docs, we often use phrase "Angular elements (or any other web component)" but this may sound a bit vague without previous insight into the topic... <br><br>' +
      'The web standard is in fact called "Web Components" and it uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements" target="_blank">Custom Elements API</a> to create and use web components which are <strong>new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags</strong> to use in web pages and web apps.<br><br>' +
      "Angular Elements wraps Angular components using <code>HTMLElement</code> APIs and then uses Custom Elements API, more precisely the <code>customElements.define('some-element', SomeComponentElement)</code> syntax to register it for the use in the web page."
